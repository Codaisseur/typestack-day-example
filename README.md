# Typestack

This is the example implementation of day 2 of the Advanced Bootcamp working on a REST API using some Typestack packages and Typescript. 

There is a branch for every step in the reader:

* routing-controllers
* typeorm
* class-validators
* auth

The master branch is equal to the final product.
